            <p1 class="elephant-p1">
                At the Community Science Museum, we believe that science is for everyone. Our mission is to make science accessible, engaging, and inspiring for all ages and backgrounds. From curious kids to lifelong learners, we’re here to spark curiosity and ignite a passion for discovery.
                Over the centuries, humanity’s understanding of the natural world has grown exponentially, from mastering fire and water to unraveling the mysteries of galaxies and the building blocks of life. Our museum celebrates this incredible journey, offering an immersive space to explore the wonders of science in a hands-on and interactive way.

            <p1 class="volunteer-p1">From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. 
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.
